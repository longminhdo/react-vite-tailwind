# React + Vite + Tailwind CSS Template

This is a lightweight, modern template for building React applications using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the build tool and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. It provides a fast development experience with hot module replacement (HMR) and a pre-configured setup to get you started quickly.

## Features
- **React 18**: The latest version of React for building dynamic UIs.
- **Vite**: A fast, modern build tool with near-instant dev server start-up and HMR.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and customizable styling.
- **ESLint & Prettier**: Pre-configured for code linting and formatting.
- **TypeScript Support**: Optional TypeScript setup (can be removed if not needed).

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v7 or higher) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (optional)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-vite-tailwind-template.git
cd react-vite-tailwind-template
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Using npm:
```bash
npm install
```
Or using yarn:
```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server
Run the following command to start the Vite development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Or with yarn:
```bash
yarn dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

### 4. Build for Production
To create an optimized production build:
```bash
npm run build
```
Or with yarn:
```bash
yarn build
```

The output will be in the `dist` folder.

### 5. Preview the Production Build
To preview the production build locally:
```bash
npm run preview
```
Or with yarn:
```bash
yarn preview
```

## Tailwind CSS Usage
Tailwind CSS is fully configured in this template. You can use utility classes directly in your JSX:
```jsx
<div className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4 rounded-lg">
  Hello, Tailwind!
</div>
```

To customize Tailwind, edit the `tailwind.config.js` file:
```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

## Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Start the development server.
- `npm run build` - Build the app for production.
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build.
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check for code issues.
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier.

## Customization
- **Add Fonts**: Import fonts in `src/index.css` or via Tailwind config.
- **Add Plugins**: Install Tailwind plugins (e.g., `@tailwindcss/forms`) and add them to `tailwind.config.js`.
- **TypeScript**: Rename `.jsx` files to `.tsx` and update `vite.config.js` if needed.
